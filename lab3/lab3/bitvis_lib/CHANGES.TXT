Bitvis Utility Library - Overview on Versions and Changes
==============================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------


v2.1.0
----------
Released: 2013-09-25

Note to users: 
- If you use custom compile scripts, 
  you must change the Bitvis_Util source 
  directory name from src to src93, src2002 or src2008, 
  depending on which VHDL version you compile for. 

General: 
- Added support for vhdl2008. 
- Made a separate source directory for each vhdl version: src93, src2002 and src2008
  The user must choose which of these src directories to compile
- New compile scripts, in order to be able to choose between using the vhdl93, vhdl2002 or vhdl2008 version 
- report_alert_counters() may now be called with an argument: 
  - INTERMEDIATE = Print alert counters only
  - FINAL        = Print counters and print simulation conclusion (Success/Fail)
                   Typically call with FINAL from the end of the test sequencer

New features: 
- Added new random functions and procedures: random sl and time

v2.0.0
----------
Released: 2013-08-09

General:
Major modifications to make a vhdl'93 compatible version, and at the same time maintain a 2002
compatible version to allow 100% safe update of shared variables. To minimise the differences
all protected variables that are not functionally needed for safe behaviour have been changed
into ordinary shared variables - for instance when only a single process is allowed to modify
a shared variable and no critical interaction between modification and a pure read.

Common changes for vhdl'93 and 2002:
- Type changes (Note: Changes related to this type changes are not listed explicitly)
  - from protected to normal shared - with corresponding name change
  - shared_initialised_util
  - shared_msg_id_panel
  - shared_log_file_name_is_set
  - shared_alert_file_name_is_set
  - shared_warned_time_stamp_trunc
  - shared_alert_attention
  - shared_stop_limit
  - shared_log_hdr_for_waveview
  - shared_seed1
  - shared_seed2
  - t_attention has been replaced by t_attention, which has a new litteral 'EXPECT'
(Litteral COUNT has been replaced by REGARD, as they are all really counters)
  -  Replaced protected methods in 'methods' by standard functions defined in a new package
  'vhdl_version_layer' with functions to access protected or standard shared depending
  on compatibility requirements. Hence there are two file versions of 'vhdl_version_layer'.

  - Added message IDs
  - ID_VVC_CONSTRUCTOR :  ***** Er navnet et felles navn????
  - Some internal functionality has been modified or removed. Not visible for users.
  - Improved some alert messages
  - Fixed wrong order of scope and msg in alert calls in normalise-procedures

  Changes NOT common for vhdl'93 and 2002:
  - vhdl_version_layer split into vhdl_version_layer_93 and vhdl_version_layer_2002
  - vhdl93: Substituted protected alert counter with ordinary shared variable.


  v1.0.0
